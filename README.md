# Auto Kz - My First Web Project

## Project Description
This is my first web project created in my 1st year of university (2nd semester, 2023) as part of the "Web Technologies Basics" course. A simple car catalog with filtering system and user authentication.

## Functionality
- 📋 Car catalog with detailed information
- 🔍 Filtering by brands, countries, and categories
- 👤 Login/authentication system
- 🌍 Multilingual interface (Russian/Kazakh)

## Technologies
- **Backend**: PHP (pure, no frameworks)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript
- **Database**: Static PHP array
- **Server**: XAMPP (local development)

## Project Structure
```

```

## Features

- Simple authentication system
- Filtering via GET parameters
- Mixed language interface

## How to Run

## Reflections
This is a first-year project created while learning web development fundamentals. The code reflects my understanding at that time and contains typical beginner patterns - no password hashing, hardcoded data arrays, and mixed presentation with logic. It represents an important learning milestone in my development journey.
